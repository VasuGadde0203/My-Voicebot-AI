1. What should we know about your life story in a few sentences?
"I come from a background in IT and have always been passionate about understanding how things work behind the scenes. Over time, I developed a strong interest in data—how it can tell stories, solve problems, and drive decisions. I’ve worked on projects ranging from data visualization to API integration, and I’m continuously exploring new technologies to keep growing in this field."

2. What’s your #1 superpower?
"My superpower is adaptability. I learn quickly and thrive in situations where I need to figure things out fast—whether it's learning a new tool, debugging a tough issue, or switching roles on a team."

3. What are the top 3 areas you’d like to grow in?

Advanced Machine Learning & AI Concepts – to deepen my technical capabilities.

Effective Communication & Storytelling with Data – to better present insights to non-technical stakeholders.

Leadership & Mentoring – to contribute more strategically to team and project success.

4. What misconception do your coworkers have about you?
"Sometimes people assume I’m very quiet or reserved, but once I’m comfortable, I contribute a lot with ideas, feedback, and collaboration. I just take a little time to observe before jumping in."

5. How do you push your boundaries and limits?
"I deliberately take on tasks or projects that are slightly outside my comfort zone. I break them into manageable parts, seek guidance when needed, and treat every challenge as a learning opportunity. This approach has helped me grow faster and build confidence over time."
